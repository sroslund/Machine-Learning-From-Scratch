# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
A python project implementing a simple machine learning framework

The framework is used to generate a very simple number recognition system using a single linear layer on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The number recognition system achieves 78% correct classifcation rate on a testing set seperate from the training set.

The same framework is also used to fit a function to a set of points.
